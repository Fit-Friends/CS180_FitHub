## Motivation
In today's fast-paced world, where time is often a scarce resource, staying fit and healthy has become a significant challenge for many. This realization sparked our motivation to create a simple, yet effective bodyweight fitness app. Our vision is to empower individuals, regardless of how busy they are. They will be able to perform simple bodyweight workouts and compete with their friends. The app is designed to offer easy-to-follow, equipment-free workout routines that can be performed anywhere, anytime. By using the simplicity of bodyweight exercises, we aim to make fitness accessible and achievable for everyone. This project is not just about building an app; it's about encouraging people that fitness can be a shared journey, a part of daily life, and a source of joy and wellness for all.


## Our Proposed Project
One of the most common barriers that hinder the progress of individuals is bar none maintaining a consistent and effective fitness routine. To make matters worse, factors such as time, the lack of a support system, and unrealistic goals further complicate things. FitHub is motivated by the desire to make the fitness journey more engaging and user-friendly. The app goes beyond traditional tracking, incorporating gamification elements. It aims to address how everything within the user experience interacts. 

## Functionalities
A key functionality of our app is the inclusion of a leaderboard where friends can view their progress. It displays the names alongside their daily fitness achievements (e.g., steps per week, miles ran, weight loss, etc.). Therefore, a bit of friendly competition provides users with a sense of accountability and inspires them to push each other to their limits. Our app *(FitHub)* will center around 4 main functionalities:

### Account creation
New users will be able to create and login to their personalized accounts where they can add and follow other profiles.

### Personalized profile
Includes name, age, weight, and profile picture

### Adding/Following other user profiles
Complementary to account creation, our app will provide the functionality of allowing users to follow and add other friends and profiles. This adding/following functionality will allow any user to see the progress and workout activity of other accounts to view in the leaderboard system.

### The logging functionality
Allows users to record physical activity and exercises (e.g., steps, push-ups, sit-ups, squats, lunges) to monitor their progress.

### Leaderboard system
within user list compares others exercise data and ranks them

## Feasibility Analysis and Challenges
This project is feasible because we planned to select a front-end, back-end leader who has experience on JS and Python Django. They will lead other team members to learn new frameworks and check each progress. We planned to use Kanban Board in the GitHub repository to control the functionality of the application. Team members can see the progress of the functions of the application.


For our project, beginners wil learn the programming language and framework for 2 weeks, the team leaders will design the front-end, back-end and database.For designing front-end, all teammates will suggest ideas using slide or hand drawing. After 2 weeks, we will start to make a project. 
For the project, we decided to use the traditional DLC model to resolve our differing levels of experience. This approach will allow us to acknowledge how we inevitably will be learning new things. We are also going to attend lab sessions to check in with the TAs in case potential setbacks arise.
